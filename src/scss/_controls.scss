$sidebarText: "Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker set a new NFL field goal record on Sunday, hitting from 66 yards â€” nearly 200 feet. The football smacked the crossbar and bounced through the goal, sealing a win over the Detroit Lions with time running out. The record setting kick did not come without controversy, however, on the play prior to the field goal, officials missed the play clock running out which should have pushed the Ravens further back";
